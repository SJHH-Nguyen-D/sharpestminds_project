## Building the Project



## Extra

I recently discovered Python Black, the uncompromising programming formatter and have been use applying it liberally in a few of my scripts. Just make sure you have it installed with this command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user black
```

And then run this to black-ify your script. Using the ```--diff``` option allows you to see the difference the reformatting would make. Much like the same command in git.

```python3
black myscript.py
```
