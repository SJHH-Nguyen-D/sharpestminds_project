# Sharpest Minds Project

## Background

As part of the Sharpest Minds mentorship program, mentees choose to develop an end-to-end data science project on their own with the guidance of an experienced data scientist mentor from the organization. An end-to-end project comprises of acquiring your own dataset by a variety of methods; preprocessing the data; exploring the data; feature selection and engineering; model selection, model training, model validation; and parameter tuning. The ultimate goal of the project would be to provide inferences for a user through a web API or application, using either Django or Flask, given user input.

The project is currently under construction.

## Data Acquisition

The dataset was acquired from crawling and scraping the following online resources using ```./utils/webscraper.py``` script:

## Extra

I recently discovered Python Black, the uncompromising programming formatter and have been use applying it liberally in a few of my scripts. Just make sure you have it installed with this command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user black
```

And then run this to black-ify your script. Using the ```--diff``` option allows you to see the difference the reformatting would make. Much like the same command in git.

```python3
black myscript.py
```
