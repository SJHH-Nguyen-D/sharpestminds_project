* Where I am
	* Feeling like I want to keep looking to skilling up on the things that I don't know how to do yet
	* Feeling like I haven't contributed to doing the project enough
	* Feeling behind in my programming skills, and answering LeetCode problem solving programming problems
	* Feeling moderate in terms of my data science knowledge and skills

* Where I want to be
	* Finish the Sharpest Minds profile checklist

* What I know
	* Data science principles
	* ML and Deep learning pipeline
	* Traditional ML
	* Deep learning with Tensorflow and Keras
	* Data Visualization
	* Data preprocessing for various types of data structures (mainly tabular, with some NLP)
	* Feature selection and feature engineering
	* Topical knowledge of distributed databases and services
	* Git
	* Some best practices of coding

* What I feel like I need to refresh on
	* Review on the answering and doing the technical questions with respect to classical ML

* What i feel like I need to know
	* Flask
	* Django
	* PySpark
	* PyInstaller
	* Unittest vs PyTest
	* Cython
	* SQL + Oracle/MySQL,SQL Lite

	* Hive, Spark, Kafka (suggested by blog. All open source)
	* Binary Trees
	* Linked Lists
	* Sorting
	* Intermediate LeetCode problems
	* Data Science Interview problems
		* Mindset on answering some of the non-programming problem solving problems


* How/Where will you acquire the knowledge for these skills?
	* YouTube videos on those named concepts
	* Kaggle
	* (https://www.stats.stackexchange.com)


* what they are asking for in the job postings
* make sure that you have a unifying project at the end of the mentorship
* can you do tabular datasets from NLP scraping?
* how do you convert your words into lists of vectors


## Steps to take to get me back on track

###Accountability
send an email after meeting iwth charlie to jeremie as to what came of our talk.

### Vision of the Final Product
* What is the clear vision of what you want to build at the end of this? what kind of value can you built in with the project?
define a new end goal. be biased in terms of the data that you have collected. Learn how to interpret it and use it for and end goal
as a flask web app or heroku. have a well defined endgoal. exploitation versus exploration. exploit now. if you can do a thing end to end, deploy your pre existing information in this. SET A GOAL.
* what will i built to make me comfortable with my python engineering skills, list those off, and incorporate them into my final project
* go over teh feature slection stuff and engineering for NLP

### Track Your Learning
* Keep a journal of your skilling up with the Skill or topic area, explanation of why it makes sense to learn it, how you can apply it to your project, how it can be used in future projects in the future

### Organization and Discipline
* Start a journal or organizational
* Have a calender to schedule in your time
* Block off time for your scheduled work
* Eliminate distractions such as your phone and social media (YouTube) during the scheduled time, unless it is
