Dropping Redundant Features

Based on the codebook and the naming conventions for this dataset, we will explore and determine which features could be dropped due to overlapping measures. Sometimes this is done as a result of differences in coding schemes or categorical aggregations of the result. We will do some investigation on these features, their level of correlation and multicollinearity with the target variable and decide which features we can drop during the preprocessing step.

# look at these features individually and drop stepwise after analysis

Preprocessing (Dropping and Replacing) for Missing/Unavailable Value Encodings

With this particular dataset, some missing or unavailable column values are encoded as a numeric value. Some particular values that were used to encode these values are: 999, 9996, 9997, 9998, 9999, 99999. Let's have a look at them first. Our next step would be to map these values to np.nan for imputation afterwards. We make a list of these notable features.

Also note that for some features, the integer values or float are actually strings, thus making the feature column itself an object column. What we would want here is to cast these specifically as integers, after having dealt with the letter encodings. Using Int64

    v71 -> cast letters to np.nan, cast values to np.nan, cast all to Int64
    v105 -> drop

Letter columns that use numeric encodings to indicate missing:

    isic1c -> replace num string as np.nan

possible_missing_data_codes = ['999', 9995, '9995', 9996, '9996' ,9997, 9998,'9998', 9999, '9999', '99999']

Drop v105 because it is the same as isic features and we already drop those.

We then impute the missing/unavailable encoded values in isic1c with np.nan

# v105 is to v71 what isic1l is to isic1c; one refers to industry of last job and one refers to industry of current job

df.drop(['v71', 'v105'], inplace=True, axis=1)

df.isic1c.unique()

missing_values_to_replace = ['9995', '9996', '9997', '9998', '9999']

​

df['isic1c'].replace(to_replace=missing_values_to_replace, value=np.nan, inplace=True)

Drop Missing Data by Axes
Missing Data Proportion by Columns

We will want to drop a number of the columns have have a significant amount of its data missing. Some features have disproportionately more data missing than others and there will be no way to impute those features. In which case dropping those features might be the best course of action to clean up the dataset. Feature column values that have a proportion of their data missing equal to or greater than an arbitrary threshold will have their columns dropped. Afterwards, a row-wise operation of this procedure will be further applied to include cleaner samples in the dataset.

We will examine to see which features reach this threshold requirement to be dropped before we do any such dropping.

Afterwards, we will want to smarly impute the remaining missing data points as much as we can.

# features by % of missing data

dropthreshold = 50

​

pct_missing_list = list([col for col in df.columns if df[col].isnull().sum()/df.shape[0] * 100 >= dropthreshold])

dropped_columns_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(pm_list, columns=['% Missing Data'], index=pct_missing_list).sort_values(by='% Missing Data', ascending=False)

    )

         )

    

​

Missing Data Proportion By Row

An alternative strategy would be just to drop all of the rows with missing values. This step requires a little more wor as we will have more than 0 data points that have missing values and require imputation of missing values.

Lets first drop any data ROWS with 20% or more missing values and see what we end up with.

Just a refresher on how to how to conditionally select rows from a data frame:

To select rows whose column value equals a scalar, some_value, use ==: df.loc[df['column_name'] == some_value]

To select rows whose column value is in an iterable, some_values, use isin: df.loc[df['column_name'].isin(some_values)]

Combine multiple conditions with &: df.loc[(df['column_name'] >= A) & (df['column_name'] <= B)]

Conditionally set values df[label] = df.variable.where('label' == 'another_label')

# Data points with percentage of data missing and greater will be dropped from the dataset

dropthreshold = 20

​

# get the data points in the dataframe that have >= 30% of their data missing

to_drop_df = reduced_df.loc[(reduced_df.isnull().sum(axis=1)/reduced_df.shape[1]*100) >= dropthreshold]

row_reduced_df = reduced_df.loc[(

    reduced_df.isnull().sum(axis=1) / reduced_df.shape[1]*100 < dropthreshold

)]

​

report_missing(reduced_df, row_reduced_df, axis=0, dropthreshold=dropthreshold)

​

# give the new dataframe a better name

final_kept_df = row_reduced_df

​

# save the dataframe to disk after the processing

final_kept_df.to_csv('./final_kept_df.csv')

Missing Data by Data Type

We can see that there are a considerable amount of missing values for this dataset. We will have to dig in to understand which features would have missing values, and can we come up with a strategy to handle it.

# separate out the numeric and categorical variables to see how much of each are missing

def df_by_type_splitter(dataframe):

    """ a larger dataframe into immediately identifiable numeric and other type dataframes"""

    num_df = dataframe._get_numeric_data().copy()

    cat_df = dataframe.select_dtypes(exclude = [int, float]).copy()

​

    return num_df, cat_df

​

​

numeric_df, categorical_df = df_by_type_splitter(row_reduced_df)

​

​

print("Number of Numeric Features: {}".format(numeric_df.shape[1]))

print("Number of Categorical Features: {}".format(categorical_df.shape[1]))

Numeric Feature Missing Values

It still appears that after dropping the data points and features with a majority of their data points missing, that about a third of the numeric features containg NaN/missing values in more than 20% of their data points.

# take a look at the missing values from the numeric features dataframe

print("Proportionally, numeric features contribute {0:.2f}% of the total features in the dataset".format(numeric_df.shape[1]/final_kept_df.shape[1]*100))

a = pd.Series(numeric_df.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False)/(numeric_df.shape[0]) * 100)

print(a[:12])

a.plot(kind='bar')

​

# 9 numeric features of 37 with more than 20% of it's data missing

print("The number of numeric features with more than 20% of its values missing is: {}, which is {}% of all numeric features".format(9, (9/numeric_df.shape[1]*100)))

We are going to explore correlation/collinearity between the numeric features and drop redundant features.

# categorical feature with numeric encoding

​

cat_feat_with_num_encoding = ['v224','v239', 'isco2c']

for i in cat_feat_with_num_encoding:

    print("This categorical feature with numeric encodings has {} unique values: {}".format(i, len(numeric_df[i].unique())))

Although semantically inappropriate, let's, as an exercise, treat these high-category numerically encoded features as numeric features. Depening on the results of our exploration, we may go back to treating these features as categorical variables in the final model.
Pre-Imputer Imputation for numeric features

Some further processing can be done before the imputation step such as (dropping,casting, merging, etc). The next few segments of code will go through the next preprocessing steps as outlined above.

# we drop 'age_r' as there is another categorical feature containing the same demographic information with more completeness, with the tradeoff of numeric granularity

​

numeric_df.drop(columns='age_r', inplace=True, axis=1)

# we drop 'row' because this is a pretty useless category

​

numeric_df.drop(columns='row', inplace=True, axis=1)

Because v239 has many numeric encodings as a categorical feature, we can initially treat it as a numeric feature and then see whether there is a relationship between it and the response variable: 'job_performance'. We keep the variable if it is a strong predictor of employee job performance; otherwise, we drop the largely-categorized variable.

As we can gleen from the heatmap below in Seaborn, there is no correlation between the feature v239 (current occupation) and job performance of an employee, if current occuptational coding were treated as a numeric variable.

import seaborn as sns

​

o = pd.DataFrame(numeric_df['v239'].fillna(value=numeric_df['v239'].median()))

o['job_performance'] = numeric_df['job_performance']

corr = o.corr()

sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True)

What happens when we look at v239 as a categorical feature? Well, we don't really get to see much of anything at all from onehot encoding this highly categorized feature.

get_dummy_features = pd.get_dummies(o['v239'], drop_first=True)

temp_df_dummies = pd.concat([o[['job_performance']], get_dummy_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10]

print(temp_df_dummies.head())

​

corr = temp_df_dummies.corr()

sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True)

So it looks like for now, it is safe to drop this feature

# Dropping feature 'v239'

​

numeric_df.drop('v239', axis=1, inplace=True)

We will then choose to impute the rest of the missing numeric features, during our imputation step.
Examination of the categorical features

# take a look at the missing values for categorical features dataframe

print("Proportionally, categorical features contribute {0:.2f}% of the total features in the dataset".format(categorical_df.shape[1]/final_kept_df.shape[1]*100))

print((categorical_df.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False)/(categorical_df.shape[0]) * 100 )[:20])

b = pd.Series(categorical_df.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False)/(categorical_df.shape[0]) * 100 )

b.plot(kind='bar')

​

# 17 features with more than 20% of its values missing of 205 features

print("The number of categorical features with more than 20% of its values missing is: {}, which is {}% of all categorical features".format(17, 17/categorical_df.shape[1]*100))

temp = pd.DataFrame(categorical_df.columns, columns=['feature_name'])

temp['num_unique_values'] = [len(categorical_df[col].unique()) for col in categorical_df.columns]

print("There are {} features that have <=10 unique values in feature column, which could benefit greatly from categorization.".format(temp[temp['num_unique_values'] <= 10].sort_values('num_unique_values', ascending=False).shape[0]))

print("This is {0:.2f}% of the categorical features that could benefit from categorization optimization".format(temp[temp['num_unique_values'] <= 10].shape[0]/categorical_df.shape[1] * 100))

# we can see that the categorical features, because of many data points and features there are, contribute heavily to the memory usage

​

categorical_df.info(memory_usage='deep')

# have a look at the memory usage of the top 10 object columns before categorization

​

categorical_df[[col for col in categorical_df.columns if len(categorical_df[col].unique()) <= 10]].memory_usage(deep=True)[:10].sort_values(ascending=False)

We can cast some of the object features to category to better optimize for memory usage and computation, however we can only do this after the nan values and other values are imputed.
Unique categorical groupings in the categorical features

Just to get a little perspective on how many categories there are for the dataset, we will print each of their unique values for the first several features. This will help us have an idea of how much the dataset will ballon once we onehot encode for each categorical feature value.

# unique values for each categorical feature. need to know how what encoding scheme we should use

​

num_cat_gtoe_10 = []

for column in categorical_df.columns:

    if len(categorical_df[column].unique()) >= 10:

        print(f"######### {column} ##########")

        print(categorical_df[column].unique()) # returns np.ndarray

        print("Number of unique values: {}\n".format(len(categorical_df[column].unique())))

        num_cat_gtoe_10.append(column)

print("There are {} categorical columns with more than 10 categories".format(len(num_cat_gtoe_10)))

Impressions on missing categorical data

Proportionally, there are more missing numerical feature values than there are categorical feature values. There are some categorical feature values that use numeric values to indicate a discrete category or range. This can be gleened by particular values such as '9999' or '999' to indicate a missing value or distinct category. Some of the features that encode their values as such include:

    reg_tl2
    lng_home
    ageg10lfs
    ageg10lfs_t

These features are seemingly identical, and therefore we select one to keep and we drop the other:

    ageg10lfs
    ageg10lfs_t

One feature has 946 unique values which probably indicates that the values maybe numeric in nature as opposed to categorical. There are also two alphabetical letter values feature, namely : 'C' and 'G'. These values will be imputed as np.nan values before the the numeric casting of the feature column. Additionally, the numeric values in this feature are actually strings and will have to be forced cast to int or float values

    v71

Another categorical feature uses extensive numerical coding, interleaved with few alphabetic numeric coding. The instict is to cast the alphabetical coding can be cast to np.nan before the entire feature category can be cast as a numeric column, however, after looking at the value_counts for each of categories in this feature, we can decide to leave it alone as there are a signficant numer of data points that use the alphabetical encoding:

    isic2c

Can be cast to numeric:

    isic2l

This feature seems to be a more granular subfeature of 'cntryrgn' and a few other of the country based features, however this feature has significantly more unique values (176 unique values). As it is a sparser representation of the other superfeatures, it can be dropped:

    reg_tl2

There are a lot of missing values for the lng_home feature when we look at the value_counts. If questionnaire was completed in English, and the language of the exercise was done in English, then may be safe to assume that the primary language spoken at home maybe the same language. Therefore, we will apply this logic for all the missing values in the lng_home feature. These are the language categorical variables.

    lng_bq
    lng_ci
    lng_home

Some features have exactly only one categorical value. These can be dropped as they do no add further information

    uni -> only value is 'cl3770'

Instead of 'No' as the other binary value in a categorical feature, this feature has NaN instead... This value will have to be replaced with the string 'No':

    v270

Some features have a large category space, which would balloon the dataset once onehot-encoded. There are 24 columns with more than 10 categories and they are:

    ['isic1l', 'ageg5lfs', 'v71', 'earnmthalldcl', 'earnhrdcl', 'ctryqual', 'cntryid', 'reg_tl2', 'cnt_brth', 'isic1c', 'lng_ci', 'cntryid_e', 'v92', 'v59', 'edcat8', 'v31', 'lng_bq', 'v19', 'isic2l', 'lng_home', 'birthrgn', 'v212', 'earnhrbonusdcl', 'isic2c']

There are also many seemingly highly correlated and repeated features that can be dropped which pertain to information about which country or region an employee is from:

    'ctryrgn', 'ctryqual', 'birthrgn', 'cntryid_e', 'cntryid'

Our best bet would be to select to keep just one of these features - preferrably a feature with a relatively low number of categories, and then drop the rest.

Therefore we will try to do our best to reduce the number of categories by possibly coming up with higher level categories to encompass these features or cast them as numeric features if the majority of their values are numerically encoded.
Pre-Imputer Imputation for categorical features

Therefore, some of the imputation and preprocessing can be done before the encoding step of the preprocessing portion of the pipeline (dropping,casting, merging, etc). The next few segments of code will go through the next preprocessing steps as outlined above.

# NaN's -> 'No' for 'v270'

​

values = {'v270': 'No'}

categorical_df.fillna(value=values, inplace=True)

print(categorical_df['v270'].unique())

# address missing values for lng_home  and the other language features

​

categorical_df['lng_home'] = categorical_df['lng_bq'].where(categorical_df['lng_bq'] == categorical_df['lng_ci'])

​

# language features

import re

language = ['lng_bq', 'lng_ci', 'lng_home']

num_pattern = re.compile('\d\d\d')

​

# replace the 999 value with np.nan

for col in language:

    categorical_df[col].replace(to_replace=num_pattern, value=np.nan, inplace=True)

# categorical features with only one value

​

for column in categorical_df.columns:

    if len(categorical_df[column].unique()) <=1:

        print(column)

        print("The only unique value for {} is: {}".format(column, categorical_df[column].unique()))

​

# dropping column 'uni' with value only cl3770

categorical_df.drop(columns='uni', inplace=True, axis=1)

# addressing the missing values of feature reg_tl2

​

categorical_df.drop(columns='reg_tl2', inplace=True, axis=1)

# from here, we select only one of these to keep and we will drop the rest

​

country_features = ['ctryrgn', 'ctryqual', 'birthrgn', 'cntryid_e', 'cntryid']

# categorical_df[country_features].head()

​

# we decide to only keep the ctryrgn and drop the rest for now, however, cntryid is another candidate to keep if we wanted more granularity with respect to country information

categorical_df.drop(columns=['ctryqual', 'birthrgn', 'cntryid_e', 'cntryid'], inplace=True, axis=1)

# we drop 'ageg10lfs_t' because it contains identical values to 'ageg10lfs'

​

categorical_df.drop(columns='ageg10lfs_t', inplace=True, axis=1)

# drop dupe education columns

​

categorical_df.drop(columns=['v59', 'v212'], inplace=True, axis=1)

# drop neet because only one value

​

categorical_df.drop('neet', inplace=True, axis=1)

Setting Ordinality to Categorical Features

Although we touched on setting the ordinality of some of the object or categorical features earlier, now would be the time to go through the rest of the categorical features and set the ordinality for them. Unfortunately, unless you do some NLU, and NLP with another feature, we may have to go through each of the features and handcraft ordinality from the text data ourselves.

def categorical_look_filter(dataset):

    """ For each feature in a pandas dataset, print out the unique values in the dataset."""

    

    bin_feats = []

    multicat_feats = []

    

    for col in dataset.columns:

    # Binary

        if 'Yes' in dataset[col].unique() or len(dataset[col].unique()) == 2:

             

            bin_feats.append(col)

    # Multi-Category

        else:

            multicat_feats.append(col)

​

    return bin_feats, multicat_feats

    

bin_features, multicategory_features = categorical_look_filter(categorical_df)

other_bin_features = ["faet12", 'v46', 'earnflag', 'v53', 'nfe12', 'nativelang', 'v205', 'nopaidworkever', 'v84', 'paidwork5', 'fe12', 'paidwork12', 'aetpop']

binary_df = categorical_df[bin_features + other_bin_features]

Encoding Binary Features

We use a combination of pd.Categorical and mappings to encode these features.

# Mapping Binary Cases for these series

​

binary_df = binary_df.replace(to_replace={'Yes': 1, 'No': 0})

binary_df = binary_df.replace(to_replace={'Male': 1, 'Female': 0})

binary_df['faet12'] = binary_df['faet12'].map({'Did not participate in formal AET': 0, 'Participated in formal AET': 1})

binary_df['v46'] = binary_df['v46'].map({'One job or business': 0, 'More than one job or business': 1})

binary_df['earnflag'] = binary_df['earnflag'].map({'Earnings and/or bonuses imputed': 0, 'Reported directly': 1})

binary_df['v53'] = binary_df['v53'].map({'Employee': 0, 'Self-employed': 1})

binary_df['nfe12'] = binary_df['nfe12'].map({'Did not participate in NFE': 0, 'Participated in NFE': 1})

binary_df['nativelang'] = binary_df['nativelang'].map({'Test language not same as native language': 0, 'Test language same as native language': 1})

binary_df['v205'] = binary_df['v205'].map({'Unemployed': 0, 'Employed': 1, 'Out of the labour force': 2})

# These columns are apparently dataframes, so I have to switch over to using the replace method with dictionaries instead

Label Encoding

Before you can even impute for the missing values and setting up ordinality with the categorical features, you must first set up the label encoding scheme for each feature. Later, we can use the inverse encoding scheme to set up the ordinality mapping of each categorical feature.

You have to do encoding before you can impute for missing value. Therefore the plan is:

    Use the label encoder to encode the string values in the features (LabelEncoder.fit_transform(X)).
    Impute for the missing values (missing_imputer.fit_transform(X))
    Using the inverse mapping (with LabelEncoder.inverse_transform(X)) for the label encoding, set up the ordinality of the ordinal features using the specified ordinality mapping.

Nominal Cateogrical Encodings

Note: you can get the original encoding scheme back from the encoder with the le.classes_ method, which will return a list of all the unique classes in each feature. These features classes are assigned numeric encodings, based on their index in the alphabetically ordered list of the collection of all the possible classes in that feature.

Imputation for Missing Values

We want to then use an informed approach to imputation of missing data values. One method could be the use of KNN imputation or random forest and proximity matrix to imputing the missing values for our dataset with some similarity metric.

We need to import for missing values first because we can apply the astype 'category' to these categorical, and oridinal features.

# !pip install missingpy

We combine the numeric dataframe back with the categorical dataframe at this point.

You could use either Missing Forest Imputation or KNN imputation. We decide to go with KNN imputation instead.

# missing value imputation with KNN

One Hot Encoding for Nominal Features

final_df_imputed[nominal_multicategorical_feats]= final_df_imputed[nominal_multicategorical_feats].applymap(lambda x: np.round(x)).astype('int64')

Reverse the labeling before the onehotencoding so that we can tell what the groupings are from the column headers after 1HE.

Feature Selection: Forward Selection

We enter our feature selection step of the pipeline and we use an out of the box forward feature selection method from ML XTend to pick the features that result in the best predictive ability of our models. There are a number of different feature selection techniques that we could use (and we may explore that in the future), but for now, using a simple forward selection process is what we are going to stick with.
