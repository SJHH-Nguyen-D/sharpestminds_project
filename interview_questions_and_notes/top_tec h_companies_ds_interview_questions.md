## Facebook Data Science Interview Questions

1) A building has 100 floors. Given 2 identical eggs, how can you use them to find the threshold floor? The egg will break from any particular floor above floor N, including floor N itself.

2) In a given day, how many birthday posts occur on Facebook?

12) You are given two tables- friend_request and request_accepted. Friend_request contains requester_id, time and sent_to_id and request_accepted table contains time, acceptor_id and requestor_id. How will you determine the overall acceptance rate of requests?

21) You are given 50 cards with five different colors- 10 Green cards, 10 Red Cards, 10 Orange Cards, 10 Blue cards, and 10 Yellow cards. The cards of each colors are numbered from one to ten. Two cards are picked at random. Find out the probability that the cards picked are not of same number and same color.
